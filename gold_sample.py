        "title": "Fact, Fetch, and Reason: A Unified Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant performance improvements across various cognitive tasks. An emerging application is using LLMs to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These systems require LLMs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and synthesize coherent and accurate responses. Given the increasing real-world deployment of such systems, comprehensive evaluation becomes crucial. To this end, we propose FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set), a high-quality evaluation dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to provide factual responses, assess retrieval capabilities, and evaluate the reasoning required to generate final answers. While previous work has provided datasets and benchmarks to evaluate these abilities in isolation, FRAMES offers a unified framework that provides a clearer picture of LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios. Our dataset comprises challenging multi-hop questions that require the integration of information from multiple sources. We present baseline results demonstrating that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, achieving 0.40 accuracy with no retrieval. The accuracy is significantly improved with our proposed multi-step retrieval pipeline, achieving an accuracy of 0.66 (>50% improvement). We hope our work will help bridge evaluation gaps and assist in developing more robust and capable RAG systems.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, and yet, their factual inaccuracies and hallucinations limits their application, particularly in critical domains like healthcare. Context retrieval methods, by introducing relevant information as input, have emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing LLM factuality and reliability. This study explores the boundaries of context retrieval methods within the healthcare domain, optimizing their components and benchmarking their performance against open and closed alternatives. Our findings reveal how open LLMs, when augmented with an optimized retrieval system, can achieve performance comparable to the biggest private solutions on established healthcare benchmarks (multiple-choice question answering). Recognizing the lack of realism of including the possible answers within the question (a setup only found in medical exams), and after assessing a strong LLM performance degradation in the absence of those options, we extend the context retrieval system in that direction. In particular, we propose OpenMedPrompt a pipeline that improves the generation of more reliable open-ended answers, moving this technology closer to practical application.",

        "abstract": "Extracting meaningful insights from large and complex datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information. Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries. Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information. This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation. Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times. While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured domains.",

        "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context. However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge. Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks. In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory. MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture. On the one hand, it employs a light but long-range LLM to form the global memory of database. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database. On the other hand, it leverages an expensive but expressive LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information. Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity. In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied.",

        "title": "RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval",
        "abstract": "Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.",

In this work, we present Promptriever, the first retrieval model able to be prompted like an LM. To train Promptriever, we curate and release a new instance-level instruction training set from MS MARCO, spanning nearly 500k instances. Promptriever not only achieves strong performance on standard retrieval tasks, but also follows instructions. We observe: (1) large gains (reaching SoTA) on following detailed relevance instructions (+14.3 p-MRR / +3.1 nDCG on FollowIR), (2) significantly increased robustness to lexical choices/phrasing in the query+instruction (+12.9 Robustness@10 on InstructIR), and (3) the ability to perform hyperparameter search via prompting to reliably improve retrieval performance (+1.4 average increase on BEIR). Promptriever demonstrates that retrieval models can be controlled with prompts on a per-query basis, setting the stage for future work aligning LM prompting techniques with information retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has achieved remarkable success in addressing the challenges of Large Language Models (LLMs) without necessitating retraining. By referencing an external knowledge base, RAG refines LLM outputs, effectively mitigating issues such as ``hallucination'', lack of domain-specific knowledge, and outdated information. However, the complex structure of relationships among different entities in databases presents challenges for RAG systems. In response, GraphRAG leverages structural information across entities to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval, capturing relational knowledge and facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. Given the novelty and potential of GraphRAG, a systematic review of current technologies is imperative. This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of GraphRAG methodologies. We formalize the GraphRAG workflow, encompassing Graph-Based Indexing, Graph-Guided Retrieval, and Graph-Enhanced Generation. We then outline the core technologies and training methods at each stage. Additionally, we examine downstream tasks, application domains, evaluation methodologies, and industrial use cases of GraphRAG. Finally, we explore future research directions to inspire further inquiries and advance progress in the field.

        "abstract": "Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface. In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph. While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs. In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning. Toward this goal, we first develop a Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our G-Retriever method, introducing the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for general textual graphs, which can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting. To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, G-Retriever performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem. Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and mitigates hallucination.~\footnote{Our codes and datasets are available at: this https URL",

        "abstract": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to video-language tasks in a zero-shot manner.

        "abstract": "Large-scale contrastive vision-language pre-training has shown significant progress in visual representation learning. Unlike traditional visual systems trained by a fixed set of discrete labels, a new paradigm was introduced in \cite{radford2021learning} to directly learn to align images with raw texts in an open-vocabulary setting. On downstream tasks, a carefully chosen text prompt is employed to make zero-shot predictions.~To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, context optimization \cite{zhou2021coop} has been proposed to learn continuous vectors as task-specific prompts with few-shot training examples.~In this paper, we show that there is an alternative path to achieve better vision-language models other than prompt tuning.~While prompt tuning is for the textual inputs, we propose CLIP-Adapter to conduct fine-tuning with feature adapters on either visual or language branch. Specifically, CLIP-Adapter adopts an additional bottleneck layer to learn new features and performs residual-style feature blending with the original pre-trained features.~As a consequence, CLIP-Adapter is able to outperform context optimization while maintains a simple design. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on various visual classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Many recent studies leverage the pre-trained CLIP models for image-level classification and manipulation. In this paper, we wish examine the intrinsic potential of CLIP for pixel-level dense prediction, specifically in semantic segmentation. To this end, with minimal modification, we show that MaskCLIP yields compelling segmentation results on open concepts across various datasets in the absence of annotations and fine-tuning. By adding pseudo labeling and self-training, MaskCLIP+ surpasses SOTA transductive zero-shot semantic segmentation methods by large margins, e.g., mIoUs of unseen classes on PASCAL VOC/PASCAL Context/COCO Stuff are improved from 35.6/20.7/30.3 to 86.1/66.7/54.7. We also test the robustness of MaskCLIP under input corruption and evaluate its capability in discriminating fine-grained objects and novel concepts.

        "abstract": "Recently, zero-shot and few-shot learning via Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training (CLIP) have shown inspirational performance on 2D visual recognition, which learns to match images with their corresponding texts in open-vocabulary settings. However, it remains under explored that whether CLIP, pre-trained by large-scale image-text pairs in 2D, can be generalized to 3D recognition. In this paper, we identify such a setting is feasible by proposing PointCLIP, which conducts alignment between CLIP-encoded point clouds and 3D category texts. Specifically, we encode a point cloud by projecting it onto multi-view depth maps and aggregate the view-wise zero-shot prediction in an end-to-end manner, which achieves efficient knowledge transfer from 2D to 3D. We further design an inter-view adapter to better extract the global feature and adaptively fuse the 3D few-shot knowledge into CLIP pre-trained in 2D. By just fine-tuning the adapter under few-shot settings, the performance of PointCLIP could be largely improved. In addition, we observe the knowledge complementary property between PointCLIP and classical 3D-supervised networks. Via simple ensemble during inference, PointCLIP contributes to favorable performance enhancement over state-of-the-art 3D networks. Therefore, PointCLIP is a promising alternative for effective 3D point cloud understanding under low data regime with marginal resource cost. We conduct thorough experiments on Model-NetlO, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN to demonstrate the effectiveness of PointCLIP. Code is available at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/PointCLIP.",

        "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) achieves promising results in 2D zero-shot and few-shot learning. Despite the impressive performance in 2D, applying CLIP to help the learning in 3D scene understanding has yet to be explored. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate how CLIP knowledge benefits 3D scene understanding. We propose CLIP2Scene, a simple yet effective framework that transfers CLIP knowledge from 2D image-text pre-trained models to a 3D point cloud network. We show that the pre-trained 3D network yields impressive performance on various downstream tasks, i.e., annotation-free and fine-tuning with labelled data for semantic segmentation. Specifically, built upon CLIP, we design a Semantic-driven Cross-modal Contrastive Learning framework that pre-trains a 3D network via semantic and spatial-temporal consistency regularization. For the former, we first leverage CLIP's text semantics to select the positive and negative point samples and then employ the contrastive loss to train the 3D network. In terms of the latter, we force the consistency between the temporally coherent point cloud features and their corresponding image features. We conduct experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and ScanNet. For the first time, our pre-trained network achieves annotation-free 3D semantic segmentation with 20.8% and 25.08% mIoU on nuScenes and ScanNet, respectively. When fine-tuned with 1% or 100% labelled data, our method significantly outperforms other self-supervised methods, with improvements of 8% and 1% mIoU, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability for handling cross-domain datasets. Code is publicly available11https://github.com/runnanchen/CLIP2Scene",

        "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been the cornerstone for zero-shot classification, text-image retrieval, and text-image generation by aligning image and text modalities. Despite its widespread adoption, a significant limitation of CLIP lies in the inadequate length of text input. The length of the text token is restricted to 77, and an empirical study shows the actual effective length is even less than 20. This prevents CLIP from handling detailed descriptions, limiting its applications for image retrieval and text-to-image generation with extensive prerequisites. To this end, we propose Long-CLIP as a plug-and-play alternative to CLIP that supports long-text input, retains or even surpasses its zero-shot generalizability, and aligns the CLIP latent space, making it readily replace CLIP without any further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is far from straightforward, as simplistic fine-tuning can result in a significant degradation of CLIP's performance. Moreover, substituting the text encoder with a language model supporting longer contexts necessitates pretraining with vast amounts of data, incurring significant expenses. Accordingly, Long-CLIP introduces an efficient fine-tuning solution on CLIP with two novel strategies designed to maintain the original capabilities, including (1) a knowledge-preserved stretching of positional embedding and (2) a primary component matching of CLIP features. With leveraging just one million extra long text-image pairs, Long-CLIP has shown the superiority to CLIP for about 20% in long caption text-image retrieval and 6% in traditional text-image retrieval tasks, e.g., COCO and Flickr30k. Furthermore, Long-CLIP offers enhanced capabilities for generating images from detailed text descriptions by replacing CLIP in a plug-and-play manner.",

We decompose the image representation as a sum across individual image patches, model layers, and attention heads, and use CLIP's text representation to interpret the summands. Interpreting the attention heads, we characterize each head's role by automatically finding text representations that span its output space, which reveals property-specific roles for many heads (e.g. location or shape). Next, interpreting the image patches, we uncover an emergent spatial localization within CLIP. Finally, we use this understanding to remove spurious features from CLIP and to create a strong zero-shot image segmenter. Our results indicate that a scalable understanding of transformer models is attainable and can be used to repair and improve models.",

        "abstract": "The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multitask learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP : a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Worldwide Geo-localization aims to pinpoint the precise location of images taken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense variation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based approaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible to construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead, existing approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells, transforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance is limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate localizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class center. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel CLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between the image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder models the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding through random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation that captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich high-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for geo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive experiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive performance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even in limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate geo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image encoder.

        "abstract": "Various Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP) have sprung up and dramatically advanced the benchmarks for public general-domain datasets (e.g., COCO, Flickr30k). Such models usually learn the cross-modal alignment from large-scale well-aligned image-text datasets without leveraging external knowledge. Adapting these models to downstream applications in specific domains like fashion requires fine-grained in-domain image-text corpus, which are usually less semantically aligned and in small scale that requires efficient pre-training strategies. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-guided fashion-domain language-image pre-training (FLIP) framework that focuses on learning fine-grained representations in e-commerce domain and utilizes external knowledge (i.e., product attribute schema), to improve the pre-training efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art VLP models on Amazon data and on the Fashion-Gen dataset by large margins. FLIP has been successfully deployed in the Amazon catalog system to backfill missing attributes and improve the customer shopping experience.",
